The Stock Info Formulator gives the user the ability to visualize a stocks's:
  1. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  2. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  3. The total stock volume of the stock.

Running this macro will speed up the difficult process of processing stock date.
